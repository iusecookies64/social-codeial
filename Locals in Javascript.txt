If we want some information from locals(which is available in 
template engine) in our script file then we cana do following.

1. Create a html element and use data attr to store value desired

Example -
<span style="display: hidden" data-user="<%= locals.user.name %>" id="loggedInUserData"></span>

2. Now in our js file we can access this element and get the 
attr value.
